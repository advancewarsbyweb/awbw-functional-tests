# Welcome

This is the repo for the E2E automation tests for AWBW! 


# Installation Steps:

Note for Windows users: Everything in this setup is done inside WSL. A non-wsl environment might already have everything installed.

1) Open a terminal, likely in your IDE of choice. Make sure you have Node and NPM installed on your machine. Note that you might have to run `apt-get update`, `apt install node` and `apt install npm` if you don't have them.

2) Run `npm install`

3) IF IN WSL, run the following:
```
sudo apt install libnss3
sudo apt install libasound2t64
```
This should install all necessary packages to run cypress. Native linux likely has these packages already.

4) Run `npx cypress open` in order to open the cypress electron app.

5) Also, you can run `npx cypress run` in order to run the cypress tests headlessly.
